Hello, This is a friendly written warning about upcoming changes to this
project. I have been hosting these projects under Silly Little Files as a
student, with the goal to protect free speech and discourage governmental
meddling with access to information online. I believe that that goal was met
with the amazing tools provided and ease of access given by my GitHub student
perks, in a local sense. Now, while I wish I could host this project forever,
unfortunately that is simply just not feasible for me. I originally started this
project on GitHub as I believe in transparency in applications and that all code
written should be contributing to global information. Now, with the code being
public, the dream can live on. There are many projects such as mine, many with
the same goal, many with much wider anti-censorship goals. But I believe with my
documentation it can be easier for those who are willing to put the time into,
to achieve the same goals. So, the news. Around the 4th of April 2025 09:00 EST,
my domain will roll over. While I will try to see about renewing it for one more
year (2025 being my grad year), It will most likely be the last point where I
will make any meaningful changes to the websites. And if I cannot renew the
domain, it will be the last I will be hosting these projects. Self hosting
documentation currently is hosted @ https://docs2.sillylittle.tech, but is also
available on GitHub here. I am amending this notification to the README's of the
projects in scope. I wish you all the best, and best of luck for future
adventures. Warmest Wishes, @kiyarose
